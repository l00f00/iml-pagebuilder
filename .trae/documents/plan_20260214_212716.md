I will rename the `updateField` function in `includes/post-types/homepage/builder.php` to `updateHomepageField` to ensure that every builder (Project, Portfolio, Homepage) has a unique function name for updating the hidden field. This prevents any potential conflicts if scripts are accidentally loaded together.

Since I have already confirmed that `includes/post-types/portfolio/builder.php` uses `updatePortfolioField` and does not contain `updateField`, the error you are seeing (`Uncaught TypeError... at updateField`) indicates that your browser is likely running an older, cached version of the script.

After applying this change, I will ask you to perform a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) to ensure the new code is loaded.
