I will modify the `WP_Query` arguments in `includes/post-types/portfolio/builder.php` to correctly include 'progetto' and 'serie' posts.

The current query has strict filters (`post_status` set only to 'inherit' and `post_mime_type` set to 'image') that effectively exclude standard published posts like Projects.

**Changes:**
1.  Update `post_status` to allow both `'publish'` (for projects) and `'inherit'` (for attachments).
2.  Remove the `post_mime_type` restriction so that non-image post types (like Projects) are returned.

This matches the logic already working in the Homepage builder.
