I will modify the Portfolio Builder to overlay the alignment dropdown, single page indicator, and post type label on the grid item image, positioned at the bottom left.

**Plan:**

1.  **Modify `includes/post-types/portfolio/builder.php` (PHP Rendering):**
    *   Wrap the alignment select, single page indicator, and post type label in a new container `div` with a class like `item-controls-overlay`.
    *   Ensure this container is inside the `.grid-item` but positioned absolutely over the image.

2.  **Modify `includes/post-types/portfolio/builder.php` (JS Rendering):**
    *   Update the JavaScript that generates the grid item HTML when adding a new item (`$('#add-item').on('click', ...)`) to match the new structure.
    *   I need to make sure I add the alignment select in the JS version as well (currently it might be missing or added differently, checking the code it seems the JS version adds `<p>` title but the PHP version adds the select. Wait, the JS in `portfolio/builder.php` (lines 363-376) *does not* currently add the select dropdown! It just adds title and remove button. The select appears after reload? No, that would be a bug. Ah, I see in the PHP `portfolio_render_grid_item` there is a select. The JS *should* also add it if we want it to be editable immediately.
    *   *Correction:* The user said "il piccolo dropdown destra sinistra centro... devo essere in sovraimpressione". If the dropdown isn't there in JS, I should add it.
    *   *Observation:* The current JS code:
        ```javascript
        var gridItemHTML = '<div class="grid-item" data-id="' + item.id + '">' +
            '<button type="button" class="remove-item">Remove</button>' +
            '<p>' + item.title + '</p>';
        ```
        It seems the JS version is very simplified. I should align it with the PHP version or at least create the structure for the overlay.
    *   *However*, the user is likely looking at the *existing* items (rendered by PHP) and wants them styled. I will focus on the PHP rendering first and foremost, and try to match the JS structure if possible, but the PHP structure is what persists.

3.  **Modify `includes/post-types/portfolio/admin-style.css`:**
    *   Add styles for `.item-controls-overlay`:
        *   `position: absolute;`
        *   `bottom: 0;`
        *   `left: 0;`
        *   `width: 100%;`
        *   `padding: 5px;`
        *   `background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8);` (semi-transparent background to make text readable) or just rely on text shadow? A background is safer for inputs.
        *   `z-index: 5;`
    *   Style the select and text within this overlay to be compact.

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**

1.  **Edit `includes/post-types/portfolio/builder.php`:**
    *   In `portfolio_render_grid_item`:
        *   Move the `select`, `single page span`, and `post type div` inside a wrapper `<div class="item-controls-overlay">`.
    *   In the JS `$('#add-item').on('click')` handler:
        *   Update the HTML generation to include this wrapper and the select box (I'll need to infer orientation or default to horizontal/square for new items, which is fine).

2.  **Edit `includes/post-types/portfolio/admin-style.css`:**
    *   Add the CSS rules for `.item-controls-overlay`.

This will place the controls in the bottom-left over the image as requested.
