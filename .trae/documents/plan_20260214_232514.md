The user is panicking because the site is broken ("non ha risolto :( aiuto", "va' male male").
They specifically requested to go back to commit `744137fc615ffd25bad5cae4647e5dee250b6609`.

**Commit Analysis:**
`744137f`: "Disable fetching categories/tags/year for attachments in Portfolio Frontend to prevent errors" (Date: 23:47:50)

This commit is **10 commits ago** in the log I just retrieved?
Let's see:
1. `b0d5a21` (Current)
2. `9173786`
3. `3dd450a`
4. `830181c`
5. `09891ed`

10. `744137f` (Target)

**The User's Request:**
"torna qui commit 744137fc615ffd25bad5cae4647e5dee250b6609"

**Plan:**
I will perform a hard reset to that specific commit.
`git reset --hard 744137fc615ffd25bad5cae4647e5dee250b6609`
`git push --force`

This will:
*   Undo my "Restore year/tags/categories" (latest)
*   Undo "Fix octal literal"
*   Undo "Fix Fatal Error 500 in Attachment Frontend"
*   Undo "Remove Single Page icon"
*   Undo "Fix Invalid argument supplied for foreach in Archive"
*   **Restore** the state where I *disabled* fetching categories/tags/year.

**Wait**, the commit message says "Disable fetching...".
So reverting TO this commit means we are in the state where fetching IS DISABLED.
But earlier the user said "torniamo a prima di modificare portfolio frontend per il discorso di anno e tags".
That would imply going to the commit *before* `744137f`.
But the user explicitly gave the hash `744137f`.
I will follow the explicit hash instruction. "torna qui commit 744137f..." usually means "reset HEAD to this commit".

**Verification:**
The user says "aiuto il cambio e' avvenutio negli ultimi venti minuti".
Current time is roughly 00:23 (based on commit log 00:21).
`744137f` was at 23:47. That is ~35 minutes ago.
It fits the "last 20 minutes" rough estimate (or slightly more).

I will reset to `744137fc615ffd25bad5cae4647e5dee250b6609`.

**WARNING:** This will revert the fixes for "Invalid argument supplied for foreach" in Archive, and the "Single Page Icon" removal. The user might complain about those again, but restoring stability is priority.

**Action:**
`git reset --hard 744137fc615ffd25bad5cae4647e5dee250b6609`
`git push --force`
