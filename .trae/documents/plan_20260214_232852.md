The user wants to go back "ancora uno prima" (one more commit back).

**Current HEAD:**
`744137f` - "Disable fetching categories/tags/year for attachments in Portfolio Frontend to prevent errors" (Date: 23:47:50)

**Previous Commit:**
`0851753` - "Update README with recent Portfolio Builder overlay and Attachment Single fixes" (Date: 23:46:19)

**Wait**, `0851753` is just a README update.
The one before that is `fdc8bf0`.
However, the user says "one more back".
Usually, resetting to `HEAD^` (parent of current HEAD) is the safest interpretation.

If the user wants to revert the *code change* that disabled fetching categories/tags/year, then going back to `0851753` (which was the commit *before* `744137f`) is the correct action.
Since `0851753` only touched README, the code state at `0851753` is effectively the same as `fdc8bf0` (plus README).

So resetting to `0851753` will revert the `Disable fetching...` change, which seems to be what the user wants ("torniamo a prima di modificare portfolio frontend per il discorso di anno e tags").

**Action:**
`git reset --hard HEAD^` (which takes us to `0851753`)
`git push --force`

This will effectively undo the "Disable fetching..." commit.

**Verification:**
The log shows:
`744137f` (Current)
`0851753` (Previous)

I will reset to `0851753`.
