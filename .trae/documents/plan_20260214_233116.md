The user reports a syntax error: `syntax error, unexpected ')' in .../portfolio/frontend.php on line 63`.

**Analysis of Line 63:**
```php
63→            } elseif ($post_type === 'attachment') {
```

**What I see:**
The previous block ends at line 61:
```php
61→                      </a>';
62→            
63→            } elseif ($post_type === 'attachment') {
```

This looks syntactically correct:
`if (...) { ... } elseif (...) { ... }`

**However**, look at line 40:
```php
40→                echo '<a href="' . esc_url(get_permalink($portfolio_single_item_id)) . '" class="grid-item fotoContainer ' . esc_attr($alignment) . '" data-id="' . esc_attr($portfolio_single_item_id) . '"> 
```

And line 61:
```php
61→                      </a>';
```

This is one big echo statement from line 40 to 61?
No.
Line 40 starts with `echo '...`.
Line 43: `echo '<ul>';`.
This means the echo started at line 40 MUST have ended before line 43.
Let's check line 42:
```php
42→                        <div class="categories-tags">';
```
It ends with `';`.
So `echo '... <div class="categories-tags">';`
This is valid.

Then line 43: `echo '<ul>';` - Valid.
Lines 44-52: Comments.
Line 53: `echo '</ul>';` - Valid.
Line 54: `echo '</div> ...`
```php
54→                echo '</div> 
55→                        <div class="year-title"> 
...
58→                        </div> 
59→                      </div> 
60→                      <div class="image-wrapper">' . $the_thumb . '</div> 
61→                      </a>';
```
This looks valid.

**So why unexpected ')' on line 63?**
`63: } elseif ($post_type === 'attachment') {`

Maybe the opening brace `{` for the `if` at line 33 is missing or closed prematurely?
Line 33: `if ($post_type === 'progetto' || $post_type === 'serie') {`
It opens.

Maybe the `setup_postdata($post_obj);` line (31) or previous lines have an issue?
Line 29: `if ($post_obj) {` opens.

**Wait**, look at the error log carefully: `syntax error, unexpected ')'`.
Usually means `if (...)` has a typo like `if ($a == 1))`.

Line 63: `} elseif ($post_type === 'attachment') {`
Parentheses: `(` opens, `)` closes. One pair.
Braces: `}` closes previous block, `{` opens new one.

**Is it possible there is a hidden character or I am misreading the file content?**
The file content provided by `Read` seems clean.

**What if the error is actually on line 62 or 61?**
Line 61 ends with `;`.

**Hypothesis:**
Maybe I am looking at the file content *before* the reset?
I did `git reset --hard 744137f`.
The `Read` output shows the content of `744137f`.
And in `744137f`, I *disabled* fetching categories/tags/year.
Lines 64-66 are indeed commented out:
```php
64→                // $categories = ...
```

So this IS the content of `744137f`.

**Why the error?**
Maybe the user's server has a cached version of the file or OpCache issue?
"23:28:36 ... syntax error ... on line 63".

Let's look really closely at line 63 again.
`} elseif ($post_type === 'attachment') {`

Is it possible that `$post_type` is not defined? No, defined at line 30.

**Maybe the `if` at line 33 is closed somewhere else?**
No, line 63 starts with `}` which matches the `if` at line 33.

**Is there a hidden syntax error inside the `if` block (33-61)?**
Line 46 (commented out): `if ( !empty($categories) && !is_wp_error( $categories ) ) {`
Line 51 (commented out): `}`
These are commented out properly `/* ... */`.

**Wait!**
Line 40:
```php
echo '<a href="' . ... . '"> 
41→                      <div class="info-overlay"> 
42→                        <div class="categories-tags">';
```
This is a multi-line string.
It starts at line 40 `echo '...` and ends at line 42 `...';`.
Line 40 ends with `">`.
Line 41 starts with spaces.
This is valid PHP.

**Maybe the error is `unexpected ')'` because there is a `)` where it shouldn't be?**
On line 63 there is `)`.
`($post_type === 'attachment')`.

**Could it be that `elseif` is written as `else if`?**
Both are valid.

**Let's look at the PREVIOUS file content (before I reset).**
Before reset, I had:
`if ($post_type === 'progetto' || $post_type === 'serie' || $post_type === 'portfolio')`
Now I have:
`if ($post_type === 'progetto' || $post_type === 'serie')`

**Maybe the error is not in this file but in a file included before it?**
No, "in .../portfolio/frontend.php on line 63".

**Let's try to make a trivial edit to "refresh" the file.**
I will rewrite line 63 to be separate:
```php
} else {
    if ($post_type === 'attachment') {
```
Or just re-type it.

**Wait**, look at line 33:
`if ($post_type === 'progetto' || $post_type === 'serie') {`
If there is a hidden character...

**What if I replace `elseif` with `else if`?**
It shouldn't matter.

**Actually, look at line 45:**
`/*`
Line 52:
`*/`
If `/*` is missing or `*/` is missing...
But the syntax highlighting in `Read` output (implied) suggests it's commented.

**Wait!**
Line 52: `*/`
Line 53: `echo '</ul>';`
This is correct.

**Let's look at the `Read` output again very carefully.**
```php
61→                      </a>';
62→            
63→            } elseif ($post_type === 'attachment') {
```

If I am unable to spot the error visually, I might try to run a php lint `php -l`?
I can use `RunCommand` to check syntax!

**Action:**
Run `php -l includes/post-types/portfolio/frontend.php` to verify syntax.
This is the most reliable way.

**Wait**, I am on Windows. `php` might not be in PATH.
I'll try. If not, I'll rely on visual inspection or simple rewrite.

**Another possibility:**
The user's error log timestamp `23:28:36` is *after* I did the reset?
I did the reset around `23:30`?
The user provided the log message at `23:28`.
Wait, current time (in my previous thought) was `00:23`?
Ah, the log is UTC `23:28`.
If I am at `00:23` CET (Italy?), that is `23:23` UTC.
So the log is very recent.

**Let's check syntax.**
