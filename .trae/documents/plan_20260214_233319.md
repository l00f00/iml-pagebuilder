The user says "ok lho aggiustato" (I fixed it).
This implies the syntax error is gone.

**Status Check:**
We are currently at commit `744137f` (where fetching year/tags/categories is disabled).
The user previously wanted to "go back" to this commit.
But *before* that, they said "va' male male" because of the "discorso di anno e tags".
So being at this commit might actually be the *problematic* state for the user (missing data), but at least it's a known state.

**However**, the user might want to *re-enable* the year/tags fetching now that they fixed the syntax error manually?
Or maybe they fixed the syntax error by reverting manually?

I should ask the user what they want to do next, or if there are still issues.
"ok lho aggiustato" usually means "I fixed the immediate blocking issue (the 500 error/syntax error)".

I will update the TODO list to mark the task as completed (since the user fixed it) and then ask if they need further help with the Portfolio or Attachment frontend.

**Wait**, I should verifying if the code is what I think it is.
If the user modified the file manually, my local view (via `git reset`) matches the server ONLY IF the user edited the file on the server and I haven't pulled?
No, I am editing `C:\Users\afr\Documents\iml-pagebuilder`.
The user says "lho aggiustato". Did they edit the file *locally* on this machine?
If so, I should `Read` the file to sync my context with the current state.

**Plan:**
1. Read `includes/post-types/portfolio/frontend.php` to see the user's fix.
2. Confirm with the user if they want to proceed with any other tasks (like re-adding the portfolio support or the single page icon removal, if those were desired but lost in the revert).

Actually, since the user is driving, I will just acknowledge and wait for the next command.
But to be a "proactive pair programmer", I should verify the state.

**Action:**
Read `includes/post-types/portfolio/frontend.php`.
